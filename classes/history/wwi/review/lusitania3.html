	<p>The German Embassy had warned passengers:
	Travelers intended to embark for an Atlantic 
	voyage are reminded that a state of war exists 
	between Germany and her allies and Great 
	Britain and her allies.... Vessels flying 
	the flag of Great Britain or any of her allies 
	are liable to destruction.</p>

	<p>Recent research also shows that the ship 
	was carrying arms to Britain.</p>
