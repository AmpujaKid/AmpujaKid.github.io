	<p>After its defeat in the Spanish-American War of 1898, Spain ceded its longstanding colony
	of the Philippines to the United States in the Treaty of Paris.</p>
	<p>------------------------------------------</p>
	<p>On February 4, 1899, just two days before the U.S. Senate ratified the treaty, fighting
	broke out between American forces and Filipino nationalists led by Emilio Aguinaldo who 
	sought independence rather than a change in colonial rulers.</p>
	<p>------------------------------------------</p>
	<p>The ensuing Philippine-American War lasted three years and resulted in the death of over
	4,200 American and over 20,000 Filipino combatants. As many as 200,000 Filipino civilians 
	died from violence, famine, and disease.</p>
