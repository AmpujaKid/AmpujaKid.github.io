	<p>1,200 died, including 128 Americans</p>
	<p>---</p>
	<p>Lusitania was nearing the end of her crossing, 
	as she was scheduled to dock at the Prince's 
	Landing Stage in Liverpool later that afternoon.</p>
	<p>---</p>
	<p>She was running parallel to the south coast 
	of Ireland, when the liner crossed in front of 
	U-20 at 2:10 p.m.</p>
	<p>---</p>
	<p>It was sheer chance that the liner became such 
	a convenient target, since U-20 could hardly have 
	caught the fast vessel otherwise.</p>
