	<p> Schwieger gave the order to fire one torpedo, 
	which struck the Lusitania on the starboard bow, 
	just beneath the wheelhouse.</p>
	<p>---</p>
	<p>Moments later, a second explosion erupted from 
	within the Lusitania's hull where the torpedo had 
	struck, and the ship began to founder in a much 
	more rapid procession, with a prominent list to 
	starboard</p>
	<p>---</p>
	<p>Only six out of 48 lifeboats were launched 
	successfully, with several more overturning, 
	splintering to pieces and breaking apart.</p>
